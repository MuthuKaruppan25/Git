# Git Version Control Task - 9

## Step 1: Create a Local Repository & Push It to a Remote Service

1. Create a sample Python file.

## Step 2: Stage and Commit the File
```sh
git commit -m "Initial commit on main"
```
Output:
```
[main 9820da6] Initial commit on main
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
 create mode 100644 Task-9/sample.py
```

## Step 3: Push Changes to the Main Branch
```sh
git push origin main
```
Output:
```
Enumerating objects: 5, done.
Counting objects: 100% (5/5), done.
...
To https://github.com/YourUsername/Repository.git
   a0286c7..9820da6  main -> main
```

## Step 4: Create and Switch to a New Branch
```sh
git checkout -b new-feature-branch
```
Output:
```
Switched to a new branch 'new-feature-branch'
```

## Step 5: Modify the Python File
Add a loop that iterates from 0 to 4:
```python
for i in range(5):
    print(i)
```

## Step 6: Stage and Commit the Changes
```sh
git commit -m "Updated Loop code"
```
Output:
```
[new-feature-branch 4cea1cf] Updated Loop code
 1 file changed, 3 insertions(+), 1 deletion(-)
```

## Step 7: Push the Feature Branch to Remote Repository
```sh
git push origin new-feature-branch
```
Output:
```
Enumerating objects: 7, done.
Counting objects: 100% (7/7), done.
...
remote: Create a pull request for 'new-feature-branch' on GitHub by visiting:
remote:      https://github.com/YourUsername/Repository/pull/new/new-feature-branch
```

## Step 8: Create a Pull Request on GitHub
